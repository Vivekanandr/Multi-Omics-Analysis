Exploring Brain-Neurological Problems Links with Multi-Omics and Explainable AI

   Many large-scale initiatives and health associations focus on disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia, leading to publicly available multi-omics data sets. In this report, we will integrate and explore multi-omics data (including genomics) for predicting complex disease traits. Also, utilizing Explainable AI models to derive actionable connection between human gene and its influence on neurological problems. Using explainable AI to highlight the key genes, pathways, or molecular mechanisms that differentiate the potential vulnerable gene.
